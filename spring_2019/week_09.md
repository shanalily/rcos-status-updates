## Last Week's Accomplishments

<!-- > In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week. -->

<!-- > This past week, I was able to implement the the dialog box for creating a new user in the front end. I \ -->
<!-- > learned how to send requests in JavaScript to the backend API. -->

I didn't write any code (it was an especially busy week), but I helped with the presentation and started looking into
what I want to do next.

## This Week's Plan

<!-- > In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week. -->

<!-- > After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to add accessibility features to the user creation dialog box. \ -->
<!-- > I also plan on attending the git workshop this week. -->

I want to start working on adding some manual memory management, like being able to create pointers. The idea was to prevent
a pointer from ever being used when it shouldn't be. Fortunately I'm looking into Rust ownership system already for another
class, and I wanted to work on implementing some of those ideas. I plan to do more reading this weekend.

At this point, I think there may need to be a pointer type, and a context for a pointer/array that gives more information on
how it can be used. Using this pointer when the memory has been deallocated or it is not in scope should produce a compiler
error. Aliasing shouldn't be allowed.

I'm not really sure what the syntax for using pointers would look like yet.

I also need to practice presenting for Tuesday since I kind of messed up my part of slides today.

## Anything Blocking?

<!-- > In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project. -->

<!-- > I don't know how to test the accessibility features I am going to be implementing this week, so i am going to \ -->
<!-- > ask my mentors if they have any suggestions. -->

Just the huge amount of homework I need to get done :'( taking 20 credits as a second semester senior when I only needed 12
was a silly idea.
