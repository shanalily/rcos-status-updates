## Last Week's Accomplishments

I think the reverse Polish notation function is working now, considering the output seems to match what I want it to. The
list of types representing '3 4 +' looks like
'Application {function = Application {function = BuiltIn "+", body = BuiltIn "3"}, body = BuiltIn "4"}' which I think applies
'+ 3' to 4.

## This Week's Plan

<!-- > I also plan on attending the git workshop this week. -->

I'm going to try to write a function that takes a list of untyped expressions and infers the type using the type inference
functions already written. Currently none of that is actually being used yet when a program is run. I'm not sure yet whether
I will be returning a list of substitutions or a list of ExplicitTypes (which could then be used with the precedence
application rules).

## Anything Blocking?

Not that I can think of at the moment. A lot of my struggles have been Haskell related but that's something I can work on.
