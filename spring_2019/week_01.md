## Last Week's Accomplishments

So far this semester, I have chosen a project (I joined the StillGood project because I thought it would be cool
to learn more about Haskell, maybe LLVM, and writing a language/compiler for a language) and I have been trying
to get up to speed on what tools I will need, or might need. These include Stack, Megaparsec, LLVM, and topics
like Hindley-Milner type systems and using EBNF to define program syntax.

## This Week's Plan

The syntax of the language really needs to be defined. I also want to be able to contribute something of substance.

There's a lot I don't know about Haskell so I want to brush up more on it in general, plus how to use Megaparsec.

## Anything Blocking?

It's hard to implement something when we don't have the syntax of the language defined yet, especially since I don't
know as much as the other team members.

I'm having issues pushing to the repository even though I've been added as a collaborator, so I don't know if there is
an issue with my Github settings. I think I played with the security and login settings at some point.

## Notes

<!-- > This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories. -->
I went to the Ultimate Go workshop that I heard about through RCOS this past weekend, which was 9-5 on Saturday and
Sunday, so I didn't have as much free time as I would like.
