I was really hoping to get more done since my last status update, but again I haven't been able to do much other than
reading and looking at Jordan's code, which is mostly implementing basic parsing and type inference.

## This Week's Plan

<!-- > In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week. -->

<!-- > After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to add accessibility features to the user creation dialog box. \ -->
<!-- > I also plan on attending the git workshop this week. -->
Figure out why I can't push. Try to actually push on by/on Friday perhaps?

## Anything Blocking?

Not being able to push. The learning curve in general (Haskell has a lot of seemingly quirky parts about it). Not having the syntax of the language defined.

## Notes

<!-- > This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories. -->
If I keep not being able to contribute I may have to drop RCOS and do it for 0 credits.
