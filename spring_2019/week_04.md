## Last Week's Accomplishments

<!-- > In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week. -->

<!-- > This past week, I was able to implement the the dialog box for creating a new user in the front end. I \ -->
<!-- > learned how to send requests in JavaScript to the backend API. -->

I tried writing a function to converts an expression in [reverse Polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation)
to something that can be evaluated. I think my issues were related to the type system not being finished but I think it will be
easier to work on now that more has been done. I think the initial code that had been written was using [this](http://learnyouahaskell.com/functionally-solving-problems)
tutorial. I was writing a separate function but I'm now wondering if I should go back to trying to base it off of that.

I also understand better now what is meant by an "ApplicationRule" type.

## This Week's Plan

<!-- > In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week. -->

<!-- > After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to add accessibility features to the user creation dialog box. \ -->
<!-- > I also plan on attending the git workshop this week. -->
Work on reverse polish function, ideally finish it and work on something else.

## Anything Blocking?

<!-- > In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project. -->

<!-- > I don't know how to test the accessibility features I am going to be implementing this week, so i am going to \ -->
<!-- > ask my mentors if they have any suggestions. -->
Not that I can think of at the moment. There's some new code I need to look at and my opinion might change after that.
