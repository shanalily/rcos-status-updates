## Last Week's Accomplishments

<!-- > In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week. -->

<!-- > This past week, I was able to implement the the dialog box for creating a new user in the front end. I \ -->
<!-- > learned how to send requests in JavaScript to the backend API. -->

I added command line options using the optparse-applicative library.

## This Week's Plan

<!-- > In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week. -->

<!-- > After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to add accessibility features to the user creation dialog box. \ -->
<!-- > I also plan on attending the git workshop this week. -->

Something I can do is work on command line options. I'll think of something else to do if that turns out be very little work.
Maybe I could write test cases.

I might need to clean up some of what I wrote this week, I don't like that I have a getExplicitState function, though maybe that could be helpful for testing.

## Anything Blocking?

<!-- > In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project. -->

<!-- > I don't know how to test the accessibility features I am going to be implementing this week, so i am going to \ -->
<!-- > ask my mentors if they have any suggestions. -->
Not at the moment.
