## Last Week's Accomplishments

<!-- > In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week. -->

<!-- > This past week, I was able to implement the the dialog box for creating a new user in the front end. I \ -->
<!-- > learned how to send requests in JavaScript to the backend API. -->

Worked on the presentation, did the presentation, and read about linear types and other ways of maintaining memory safety in
languages with more manual memory management. Resources I looked at included this [paper on linear types](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.55.5439&rep=rep1&type=pdf)).
Other resources are [this implementation](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/wikis/linear-types) for adding linear types to Haskell and seems to have
examples of needing linear types, and this
[summary of a paper](https://blog.acolyer.org/2018/01/24/linear-haskell-practical-linearity-in-a-higher-order-polymorphic-language/) which defined things more clearly for me
and links to a paper that might have useful ideas implementation.

## This Week's Plan

<!-- > In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week. -->

<!-- > After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to add accessibility features to the user creation dialog box. \ -->
<!-- > I also plan on attending the git workshop this week. -->

Read the material I mentioned above more closely and try to actually implement what I'm reading. There needs to be a new linear arrow
instead of the current arrow, which takes linear types, which are consumed exactly once.

Make sure that the things needed for
doing RCOS for credit are completed, like certain types of documentation.

## Anything Blocking?

<!-- > In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project. -->

<!-- > I don't know how to test the accessibility features I am going to be implementing this week, so i am going to \ -->
<!-- > ask my mentors if they have any suggestions. -->

I know we're not supposed to use other classes an excuse for not doing as much work as we meant to, but it's hard when other classes
have strict deadlines and grading rubrics, and I feel like I should try to make an important commit this week to make up for it.
