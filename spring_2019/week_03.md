## Last Week's Accomplishments

<!-- > In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week. -->

I'm still not sure why I can't push to the upstream repository remotely but I'm definitely a collaborator so I'm just
going to push from Github I guess. I edited the README to double check I'm a collaborator.

I don't seem to be able to use LLVM without clang right now so I was starting to install based on Ryan's links in the README.

## This Week's Plan

<!-- > In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week. -->

<!-- > After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to add accessibility features to the user creation dialog box. \ -->
<!-- > I also plan on attending the git workshop this week. -->
Jordan has been working on parsing, type inference, operator precedence, and other things so we discussed what maybe I could do
that isn't overly dependent on other stuff being finished first. I think the issue was that infix operators are being parsed in reverse
polish notation but to be runnable they need to represented as applications, so I'm going to try to implement the imperative algorithm
on the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) but
with Haskell (so not imperative) but where operands can also be operators because functions are first class values. Jordan said
the examples he's seen show arithmetic so the plan is to try this using arithmetic expressions and extend to other types of
expressions.

## Anything Blocking?

<!-- > In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project. -->

<!-- > I don't know how to test the accessibility features I am going to be implementing this week, so i am going to \ -->
<!-- > ask my mentors if they have any suggestions. -->
I have a plan for what to research and try to implement this week so I wouldn't say I'm blocked.
