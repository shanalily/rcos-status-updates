## Last Week's Accomplishments

I'm writing this kind of late, but I was trying to write a function that would run the type inference code when a program
is compiled. I was struggling to understand some of the code in the tutorial we've been using
([this one](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/fun/006_hindley_milner.html)) and in general about type inference, but I understand it
a little better now. Coincidentally I'm learning about type systems in another class right now and that's helping, but I'm having
some difficulties with that homework and I focused on that a lot this weekend in the hopes of understanding type inference better.

Part of the issue with the tutorial is that they implement an interpreter, which is of course not a compiler, and the
interpreter seems to rely a lot on state. I didn't know what exactly was going on with the Haskell State Monad but I have
looked more at how it's used.

A lot of my confusion is also with Haskell. There are so many ways to write the same thing... I keep getting confused by
functions that aren't very complicated.

## This Week's Plan

<!-- > In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week. -->

<!-- > After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to add accessibility features to the user creation dialog box. \ -->
<!-- > I also plan on attending the git workshop this week. -->

I need to continue writing the function that infers type while also compiling the program. I think ideally the output would
all be expressions with ExplicitTypes, to make executing application easier.

## Anything Blocking?

<!-- > I don't know how to test the accessibility features I am going to be implementing this week, so i am going to \ -->
<!-- > ask my mentors if they have any suggestions. -->
I should be able to fix my problems if I spend enough time on them. It feels weird working on this when I'm working on a similar
homework in another class that should help me learn, so getting help with that other homework and finishing it quickly should
make this easier.

## Notes

<!-- > This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories. -->
I went to the RCOS Docker workshop over the weekend, and spent a little time reading documentation again. Docker is something I wish I had more practice with.
