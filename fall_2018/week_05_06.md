## Last Week's Accomplishments

My week 4 status update included some of the week 5, which involved various backend stuff and figuring out the interface
for stops. Week 6 involved working on presentation (I had a bunch of tests and couldn't do much more). We met outside of
small group to finish the slides and practice the presentation.

## This Week's Plan

Presentation on Friday! Also, I want to add URL queries so that frontend people can get data more specific to each need,
like a single schedule or a stop with the next few times.

<!-- > Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices -->

## Anything Blocking?

Mostly getting things coordinated with team members. Some of them are fairly new to git which is making it difficult for
them to share work easily.

<!-- > In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project. -->

<!-- > Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology -->

## Notes
