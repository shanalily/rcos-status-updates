## Last Week's Accomplishments

I finished writing some functions needed for queries from the database (getting a limited number of times associated with a 
stop) and made it so they're accessible from /schedules?*schedule query conditions*. Our group presented.

## This Week's Plan

I'm a little unsure what I can do right now but I'm going to look at the front-end people's code and make sure the JSON is 
nicely formatted for them. I will also add the "dropoff" attribute and see what I can clean up. I want to make sure everything
Thomas needs for his command line tool is written. Maybe I will start brainstorming admin stuff but it might involve Thomas's
code and the admin code that's being written by someone else right now.

<!-- > Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices -->

## Anything Blocking?

I think a lot of things going forward need to be coordinated with other people (which is just how things work).

<!-- > In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project. -->

<!-- > Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology -->

## Notes

<!-- > This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories. -->
