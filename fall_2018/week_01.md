## Last Week's Accomplishments

I wasn't at the last RCOS meeting because I was at GHC, but the meeting before that I finished getting shuttle tracker set up and can actually run it. I actually had many of the dependencies installed already, so it mostly wasn't too bad.

I'm interested in working on creating nice shuttle schedules, but if there's too many people to get anything done (I've experience that before) than I will try to find something else.

## This Week's Plan

I want to actually get some work done! I will see today what tasks I'm needed for.

## Anything Blocking?

I'm blocked by the fact that I've been busy (three tests this week, not here last week, etc) but I really want to start helping out.
