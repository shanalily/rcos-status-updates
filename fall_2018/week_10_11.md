## Last Week's Accomplishments

I didn't really do anything because of all my work in other classes. I'm not doing RCOS for credit this semester so I
figured it's okay since I've written code in earlier weeks and tried to help other team members get started and help them
with their bugs.

<!-- > In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week. -->

<!-- > Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions -->

## This Week's Plan

I am going to flesh out tests and get them to pass for schedules, and maybe that will give me ideas on how I could write
other shuttle tracker tests. I also want to see if I can write a query that gets the data more into a format like what
Thomas wrote, or that can easily be converted to that, since the front end folks like that better.

<!-- > In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week. -->

<!-- > Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices -->

## Anything Blocking?

Not being able to see people in person will make things difficult, I suppose, but I had a decent amount of work in every
other class and couldn't get to this or many other things.

<!-- > In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project. -->

<!-- > Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology -->

## Notes

<!-- > This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories. -->
