## Last Week's Accomplishments

I asked some questions about where we should be getting the data for schedules from, and started working on creating the database tables for the schedule. I think I have a better idea of how things fit together now.

<!-- > In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week. -->

## This Week's Plan

Agree on what tables we need and design stuff in general.

<!-- > In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week. -->

<!-- > Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices -->

## Anything Blocking?

Communication has been difficult. I think several of us started working on same things, and did't let each other know in the slack channel we have.

<!-- > Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology -->
