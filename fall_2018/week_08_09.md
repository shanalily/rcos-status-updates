## Last Week's Accomplishments

I added some small changes like dropoff attribute (sounds like it might not be needed now though) and allowing schedule
URL without query so you can get all schedules. I wasn't sure what to do next so I started writing tests. I did some of this
during a bonus session last week right before break.

## This Week's Plan

I have looked at the front-end code and we're definitely going to need to change some things, however we need to combine repos
which can't be done until the other repo is fixed to work with recent changes in original fork. There's also stuff related to
formatting time (add a layer of abstraction so front-end deals with strings and not ints) but another team member is supposed
to be doing that.

<!-- > Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices -->

## Anything Blocking?

I don't really have work I can do right now so I will have to come up with something, like adding more testing.
